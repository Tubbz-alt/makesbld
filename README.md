Slackware Package Builder

Peter Hyman <pete@peterhyman.com>
Original concept by Jim Simmons (formerly <tg@linuxpackages.net>)
The Create_Docs function is based on a concept
in the checkinstall program:

Felipe Eduardo Sánchez Díaz Durán <izto@asic-linux.com.mx>
The various functions in makesbld.inc are inspired by the
Gentoo Linux ebuild system.
